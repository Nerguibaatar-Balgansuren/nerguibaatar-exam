            <h2> History </h2>
            <p>
                Square's first games were released for the Nintendo Family Computer (also known as the "Famicom", and
                known
                internationally as the Nintendo Entertainment System) and the Famicom Disk System. Their early games
                were
                not very successful. In 1987, Square employee Hironobu Sakaguchi decided to create his last game for the
                company. The result was Final Fantasy, a computer role-playing game for the Famicom.

                The term "Final" was picked because he was planning on retiring from the gaming industry and that Final
                Fantasy was going to be his last game. Final Fantasy did much better than Sakaguchi and Square had
                hoped,
                and led to a North American distribution deal with Nintendo of America, who released to market Final
                Fantasy
                in the United States in 1990. Due to its success, Hironobu Sakaguchi's plans for retirement ended and he
                stayed at Square to develop new Final Fantasy games.

                Final Fantasy was followed by a sequel in 1988, Final Fantasy II, which went unreleased outside Japan
                until
                Final Fantasy Origins. North American localization was originally planned for the Famicom version of the
                sequel, but given the age of the game at that point, and the imminent arrival of Nintendo's Super
                Famicom
                (known internationally as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System), it was abandoned in favor of the
                Super
                Famicom Final Fantasy IV.

            <h2> The Early Years </h2>

            In September of 1983 Masafumi Miyamoto, a graduate of Waseda University in Tokyo, founded Square as an
            offshoot of the Den-Yu-Sha power line construction company which was owned by his father. The company was
            focused on computer technology and before they began making any games they were able to generate income by
            renting out their PC's for use by the local students.

            It was in those embryonic years that two young programmers named Hironobu Sakaguchi and Hiromichi Tanaka
            were hired by Square, just as the company had begun to look into making games. Their first game was released
            for the PC in 1984 titled " The Death Trap", it flirted with some of the storytelling elements which would
            later become a company staple. The game was a success and was followed by a sequel, "Will: The Death Trap
            II", a year later. Square's first console game would come in that same year when they were responsible for
            the NES port of Thexder.

            <h2> Independance and the First Final Fantasy </h2>

            By the end of 1986, Square was able to leave Den-Yu-Sha to become a fully independent company officially
            titled "Square Co. Ltd". Many of the staff were brought on-board full time and Sakaguchi was made Director
            of Planning and Development. After developing a slew of titles for the NES within the space of a year, most
            of which garnering only modest success, the company was faced with the possibility of bankruptcy in 1987.

            With only enough resources available to make one more game, Sakaguchi decided that his talents lay in being
            able to tell a compelling story and so he began assembling a team that would be able to rescue Square's
            future in the games industry. Final Fantasy brought together composer Nobuo Uematsu (with whom Sakaguchi had
            worked on several of Squares previous titles), artist Yoshitaka Amano (who inspired the look and characters
            in the game) and Sakaguchi's old friend Tanaka to design the game.

            The success of Final Fantasy and its sequels would make it Square's main franchise and along with games such
            as Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Xenogears, Parasite Eve and Vagrant Story cause many to regard them as
            the world's leader in RPG development.

            <h2> The PlayStation Era and Beyond </h2>

            By the mid-90s, the 32 and 64-bit systems had begun to arrive and Square began planning an epic 3d Final
            Fantasy to accompany the shift forward in technology. They disputed Nintendo's decision to stick with a
            cartridge based console which eventually caused them to end their long-term relationship with the company in
            favor of Sony Playstation's disc-based system in 1996. When Final Fantasy VII was released, it broke sales
            records and became the highest selling Final Fantasy to date, receiving universal critical acclaim.

            Although primarely known for their RPGs during the PlayStation and into the PlayStation 2 era, the company
            began slowly branching into other genres. Tobal No 1 was Square's foray into fighting games, and it was
            followed by Bushido Blade (1997) and Bushido Blade 2 (1998). Still, Square's bread and butter was RPGs and
            they released some of their best known during this period. In addition to the Final Fantasy series, Square
            also released the fan-favorite Xenogears, garnering controversy due to some of the themes of the game. With
            the PlayStation 2, Square continued to focus on diversifying their output, releasing the racing game Driving
            Emotion Type S as well as the beat 'em up The Bouncer, both of which were poorly received by critics.

            During this time, talks began between Square and long running RPG rival Enix over a merger between the two
            companies. Though the financial failures of Square's foray into film Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within
            caused Enix to delay the talks, the two companies joined to form Square Enix on April 1, 2003.
